## Project Description

Project Idea: Task Management Application

Description:
Create a task management application where users can create, update, and manage their tasks. The application should have the following features:

- User Registration and Authentication: Users should be able to register and authenticate themselves to access the application.

- Task Creation: Users can create new tasks by providing a title, description, and due date.

- Task Listing: Display a list of tasks with their title, description, due date, and status (e.g., completed, pending).

- Task Update and Deletion: Allow users to update the details of a task or delete a task if it's no longer needed.

- Task Filtering and Sorting: Provide options to filter and sort tasks based on various criteria such as due date, status, or priority.

- Each task can have unlimited sub tasks inside it.

- User Collaboration: Allow users to collaborate by sharing tasks with other registered users and assigning tasks to specific users.

- Notifications: Implement notifications to inform users about task updates, upcoming due dates, or new task assignments.

- Responsive Design: Ensure the application is responsive and can be used on different devices and screen sizes.
